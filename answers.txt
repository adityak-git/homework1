What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Rebase overwrites commit history on one branch, removing what was once on that branch, wwhile merging preserves the history of both branches.
What is a remote repository?
A remote repository hosts your projects on a network or on the internet, often to aid in version control. These can be accessed from anything connected to the remote network, not just your local machine.
